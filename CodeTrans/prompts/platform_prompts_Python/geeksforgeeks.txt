1. Python Code:
from math import *
def nthTerm ( n ) :
    return pow ( n , 2 ) + 2 * n + 2
if __name__ == "__main__" :
    N = 4
    print ( nthTerm ( N ) )


1. Steps: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: First of all identify global variables and their types. Global variables are variables that are not inside scope of function and class declarations, present in the above Python Code-
Global variables: N

Step 2: Identify classes and functions declarations present in the above Python Code-
Identified classes and functions declarations in the Python code:
def nthTerm ( n ) :

if __name__ == "__main__" :


Step 3: Considering Step 1 and Step 2, the corresponding Java Code should have declarations of these classes, functions and Global variables -
Identified classes, functions and Global variables declarations in the Java code:
public class Main {
    static int N;

    static int nthTerm(int n);

    public static void main ( String [ ] args );

}

Step 4: Complete translation of the above Python code to Java code by considering identified classes, functions and Global variables declarations in Step 3. While generating the Java code, keep track of required library imports to be added in the Java Code. Make sure your generated code is syntactically correct-
1. Java Code:
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static int nthTerm(int n) {
        return (int) Math.pow(n, 2) + 2 * n + 2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 4;
        System.out.println(nthTerm(N));
    }
}

2. Python Code:
def minSum ( arr , n , x ) :
    Sum = 0
    largestDivisible , minimum = - 1 , arr [ 0 ]
    for i in range ( 0 , n ) :
        Sum += arr [ i ]
        if ( arr [ i ] % x == 0 and largestDivisible < arr [ i ] ) :
            largestDivisible = arr [ i ]
        if arr [ i ] < minimum :
            minimum = arr [ i ]
    if largestDivisible == - 1 :
        return Sum
    sumAfterOperation = ( Sum - minimum - largestDivisible + ( x * minimum ) + ( largestDivisible // x ) )
    return min ( Sum , sumAfterOperation )
if __name__ == "__main__" :
    arr = [ 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 6 ]
    n = len ( arr )
    x = 3
    print ( minSum ( arr , n , x ) )


2. Steps: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: First of all identify global variables and their types. Global variables are variables that are not inside scope of function and class declarations, present in the above Python Code-
Global variables: arr, n, x

Step 2: Identify classes and functions declarations present in the above Python Code-
Identified classes and functions declarations in the Python code:
def minSum ( arr , n , x ) :

Step 3: Considering Step 1 and Step 2, the corresponding Java Code should have declarations of these classes, functions and Global variables -
Identified classes, functions and Global variables declarations in the Java code:
public class Main {
    static int[] arr;
    static int n;
    static int x;

    static int minSum(int arr[], int n, int x);

    public static void main ( String [ ] args );

}

Step 4: Complete translation of the above Python code to Java code by considering identified classes, functions and Global variables declarations in Step 3.

        int Sum = 0; 
        int largestDivisible = -1, minimum = arr[0]; 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
            Sum += arr[i]; 
            if (arr[i] % x == 0 && largestDivisible < arr[i]) 
                largestDivisible = arr[i]; 
            if (arr[i] < minimum) 
                minimum = arr[i]; 
        } 
        if (largestDivisible == -1) 
            return Sum; 
        int sumAfterOperation = Sum - minimum - largestDivisible + (x * minimum) + (largestDivisible / x); 
        return Math.min(Sum, sumAfterOperation); 
    } 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int arr[] = {5, 5, 5, 5, 6}; 
        int n = arr.length; 
        int x = 3; 
        System.out.println(minSum(arr, n, x)); 
    }
